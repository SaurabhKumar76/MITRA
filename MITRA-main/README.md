# MITRA
MITRA (An Semi-Autonomous Agricultural Robot)
## Description:
In MITRA, I've played a pivotal role in redefining autonomous agriculture through the creation of an innovative weed and crop management solution. Fusing advanced technologies, I led the integration of YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning models, AI algorithms, and state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. This empowered the MITRA robot to make instant decisions by accurately distinguishing between weeds and crops
Utilizing AutoCAD expertise, I meticulously designed and executed a sophisticated robotic arm that seamlessly fits into the system. This integral component, carefully crafted with considerations for kinematics, dynamics, and optimal end-effector configuration, ensures precise weed removal while safeguarding crop health.

### Robotics Leadership:
